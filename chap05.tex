\chapter{Examples}
\label{cha:examples}


This chapter contains a few another examples from the literature
dealing with chemical reactors. The examples were chosen to
illustrate the ability of the~\fun{dynopt} package to treat the
problems of varying levels of difficulty. The example files can be
found in the directory~\subor{examples/problemX}, where X means the
number of the problem presented in this chapter.

\section{Tubular Reactor}
\label{sec:prob4}

Consider a tubular reactor with  parallel
reactions $A \rightarrow B$, $A \rightarrow C$ taking place
\citep{raj01,dad95,log89} (MATLAB code for this example is located
at \subor{examples/problem4}):
\begin{equation}
\max_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} = x_{2}(t_{f}) \label{eq:tubular}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_1 &=-(u+0.5u^2)x_{1} &x_1(0) &= 1 \\
\dot{x}_2 &=ux_1 &x_2(0) &= 0 \\
u &\in [0,5] & t_f &=1
\end{align*}
where 
\begin{description}
\item $x_{1}(t)$ -- dimensionless concentration of A,
\item $x_{2}(t)$ -- dimensionless concentration of B,
\item $u(t)$ -- control variable.
\end{description}

This problem was treated by~\cite{dad95,log89,raj01} and the value of
performance index of value of 0.57353 was reported as global optimum
by \cite{dad95}. Moreover the value of 0.57284 was reported by
\cite{raj01}. By using 6 collocation points for state variables,
2 collocation points for control variables on the same number of
intervals as in the literature to this problem, we obtained a slightly
closer value of performance index of 0.5734171 to the reported global
maximum (109 iterations, exitflag equal to~1). Ipopt needed more than
11200 iterations and converged to 0.57305461.  
The optimal control
and state profiles are given in Figs. \ref{fig:prob4_u} and
\ref{fig:prob4_x}.

\section{Batch Reactor}
\label{sec:prob5}

Consider a batch reactor~\citep{raj01,dad95} where a series of
reactions $A \rightarrow B\rightarrow C$ is involved. This example is
similar to that in section \ref{sec:brpdae}. The difference is just in
the reactor model description. Here the process is described as an ODE
system (MATLAB code for this example is located at
\subor{examples/problem5}):
\begin{equation}
\max_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} = x_{2}(t_{f}) \label{eq:batch}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_1&=-k_{1}x_{1}^{2} &x_1(0) &= 1 \\
\dot{x}_2&=k_{1}x_{1}^{2}-k_{2}x_{2} &x_2(0) &= 0 \\
k_1 &=4000e^{(-\frac{2500}{T})} &k_2 &=620000e^{(-\frac{5000}{T})} \\
T &\in [298,398] & t_f &=1 \\
u &= \frac{2500}{T}
\end{align*}
where
\begin{description}
\item $x_{1}(t)$ -- concentration of A,
\item $x_{2}(t)$ -- concentration of B,
\item $T$ -- temperature (control variable).
\end{description}

The objective of problem~\eqref{eq:batch} is to obtain the optimal
temperature profile that maximises the yield of the intermediate
product B at the end of a specified time of operation in a batch
reactor where the reaction $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ take
place. The problem was solved using a relaxed reduced space SQP
strategy by~\cite{log89} and the value of 0.610775 was reported as
global maximum.~\citeauthor{raj01} reached the value of 0.61045. We
obtained optimal value of 0.6107682 (1000 iterations, 11468 function
evaluations, exitflag equal to~0 (maxiter exceeded), by using
5 collocation points for state variables and keeping control variable
profile as piecewise linear on 4 time intervals. This is quite closer
to the global one. The same settings for ipopt resulted in
a non-optimal solution. The optimal control
and state profiles are given in Figs.~\ref{fig:prob5_u} and
\ref{fig:prob5_x}.

\section{Catalytic Plug Flow Reactor}
\label{sec:prob6}

Consider a catalytic plug flow reactor~\citep{raj01,dad95} involving
the following reactions (MATLAB code for this example is located at
\subor{examples/problem6}):\\ 
$A \leftrightarrow B\rightarrow C$
\begin{equation}
\max_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} = 1-x_{1}(t_{f})-x_{2}(t_{f})
\label{eq:plugflow} 
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_1&=u(10x_2-x_1) &x_1(0) &= 1 \\
\dot{x}_2&=-u(10x_2-x_1)-(1-u)x_2  &x_2(0) &= 0 \\
u &\in [0,1] & t_f &=12
\end{align*}
where
\begin{description}
\item $x_1(t)$ -- mole fraction of A,
\item $x_2(t)$ -- mole fraction of B,
\item $u(t)$ -- fraction of type 1 catalyst.
\end{description}

Optimisation of this problem has also been analysed. This problem was
solved by~\cite{log89,raj01} and the optima 0.476946, 0.47615 were
reported. Value of the performance index obtained for this problem
using~\fun{dynopt} was 0.477712 (243 iterations, exitflag equal to~1,
fmincon) or 0.47745804 (165 iterations, ipopt). In this case
5 collocation points for state variables and 2 collocation points for
control variables were chosen. The number of time-intervals have been
set to 12. The optimal control and state profiles are given in
Figs.~\ref{fig:prob6_u} and \ref{fig:prob6_x}.

\section{Problem 7}
\label{sec:prob7}

Consider the following problem~\citep{luu90_52,bal01,fik02} 

\begin{gather}
\max_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} =
\int_{0}^{0.2}\big(5.8(qx_{1}-u_{4})-3.7u_{1}-4.1u_{2}\nonumber\\ % x_{8}\label{eq:e5} 
\mbox{}+q(23x_{4}+11x_{5}+28x_{6}+35x_{7})-5.0u_{3}^{2}\nonumber\\
\mbox{}-0.099\big)\dt \label{eq:cstr}
\end{gather}
such that
\begin{gather*}
\dot{x}_1  =  u_{4}-qx_{1}-17.6x_{1}x_{2}-23x_{1}x_{6}u_{3}\\
\dot{x}_2  =  u_{1}-qx_{2}-17.6x_{1}x_{2}-146x_{2}x_{3}\\
\dot{x}_3  =  u_{2}-qx_{3}-73x_{2}x_{3}\\
\dot{x}_4  =  -qx_{4}+35.2x_{1}x_{2}-51.3x_{4}x_{5}\\
\dot{x}_5  =  -qx_{5}+219x_{2}x_{3}-51.3x_{4}x_{5}\\
\dot{x}_6  =  -qx_{6}+102.6x_{4}x_{5}-23x_{1}x_{6}u_{3}\\
\dot{x}_7  =  -qx_{7}+46x_{1}x_{6}u_{3}\\

q = u_{1}+u_{2}+u_{4}\\
0 \leq u_{1} \leq 20\\
0 \leq u_{2} \leq 6\\
0 \leq u_{3} \leq 4\\
0 \leq u_{4} \leq 20\\
t_{f}=0.2
\end{gather*}
where 
\begin{description}
\item $x_{1}(t) - x_{7}(t)$ -- states,
\item $u_{1}(t) - u_{4}(t)$ -- controls.
\end{description}
Analogous to the section \ref{sec:statepathconprob}, the cost function
can be rewritten to the Mayer form by introducing a new state defined
by the integral function with its initial value equal to zero.

This problem was solved by~\cite{fik02,jac69}. Reported optimal value
of 21.757 was obtained using CVP method implemented in DYNO. For this
problem, 4 collocation points for state variables, 2 collocation
points for control variables for 10 intervals were defined and an
optimum was found at value of 21.82346 (840 iterations, exitflag equal
to~1, fmincon). The solver Ipopt did not converge after 10000
iterations. The optimal control and state profiles are given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:prob7}.

\section{Membrane System}
\label{sec:prob7}

Consider the following problem~\citep{fik10jms} which describes
diafiltration optimal design problem (MATLAB code for this example is located at
\subor{examples/problem9}):
\begin{equation}
  \min_{\alpha(t)} \mf{J} = x_2(t_f)
\end{equation}
subject to differential equations:

  \dot{x}_1 & = \frac{x_1}{ x_3}
q(x_1, x_2)\left[\mathcal{R}_1(x_1, x_2)-\alpha \right], &
 x_1(0) &= 150  \\
\dot{x}_2 & = \frac{x_2}{ x_3}
q(x_1, x_2)\left[\mathcal{R}_2(x_1, x_2)-\alpha\right], &
 x_2(0) &= 300 \\
\dot{x}_3 &= q(x_1, x_2)(\alpha - 1), &
x_3(0) &= 0.03 
\end{align}
state path constraints:
\begin{align}
  x_3(t) &\ge 0.01 \\
  x_3(t) &\le 0.035
\end{align}
final time constraints:
\begin{align}
  x_3(t_f) &= 0.01 
\end{align}
and simple bound constraints on optimized variable
\begin{align}
  \alpha &\in [0, 1] 
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{R}_1, \mathcal{R}_2, q$ are function of states
determined experimentally as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
q &=& S_1(x_2) e^{S_2(x_2) x_1} \label{eq:Jempiric} \\
\mathcal{R}_1 &=& (z_1 x_2+z_2) x_1  +  ( z_3 x_2+z_4) \label{eq:R1empiric} \\
\mathcal{R}_2 &=& W_1(x_2) e^{W_2(x_2) x_1}	\label{eq:R2empiric}
\end{eqnarray}
where $S_1, S_2, W_1, W_2$ are second order polynomials in $x_2$
\begin{eqnarray} 
S_1(x_2) &=& s_1 x_2^2 + s_2 x_2+s_3 \\
S_2(x_2) &=& s_4 x_2^2 + s_5 x_2+s_6 \\
W_1(x_2) &=& w_1 x_2^2 + w_2 x_2+w_3 \\
W_2(x_2) &=& w_4 x_2^2 + w_5 x_2+w_6 \label{eq:W}
\end{eqnarray}
and $s_{1-6}, z_{1-4},w_{1-6}$ are coefficients that were determined
from laboratory experiments with the process solution
(see Table~\ref{tab:coefficients}).

\begin{table}

The optimal control profile $\alpha(t)$ is at zero for the first part
of trajectory and one after the switch.  The volume ($x_3$) shows that
the first part of the trajectory basically decreases the volume until
it is on the lower constraint and keeps it approximately constant
until end of the batch. Thus, the optimal control strategy for this
problem represents a traditional diafiltration process with two parts:
pre-concentration followed by approximately constant-volume step until
end of the batch.  The minimum of $x_2(6) = 23.13$ was obtained with
2 piece-wise constant profiles of $\alpha$. Simulation results are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:problem-a}.

Consider a fed-batch fermentor for penicillin production with free
terminal time~\citep{ban05} where the objective is to maximize the
amount of penicillin using the feed rate as the control variable. The
problem is stated as (MATLAB code for this example is located at
\subor{examples/problem-fermentor}):

and

For this problem 3 collocation points for state variables, 2 collocation points for control variables for 5 intervals were defined.

\section{Park-Ramirez Bioreactor}
\label{sec:prob_pr_bior}

Consider the following problem~\citep{PR_bior} of the fed-batch
reactor for optimal secreted protein production (MATLAB code for this
example is located at \subor{examples/problem_pr_bior}):
\begin{gather}
\max_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} = x_{1}(t_f)x_{5}(t_f) \label{eq:bior}
\end{gather}
such that
\begin{align}
\dot{x}_1  & = g_{1}(x_{2}-x_{1})-\frac{u}{x_{5}}x_{1} & x_{1}(0) & = 0\\
\dot{x}_2  & = g_{2}x_{3}-\frac{u}{x_{5}}x_{2} & x_{2}(0) & = 0\\
\dot{x}_3  & = g_{3}x_{3}-\frac{u}{x_{5}}x_{3} & x_{3}(0) & = 1 \\
\dot{x}_4  & = -7.3g_{3}x_{3}+\frac{u}{x_{5}}x_{3} & x_{4}(0) & = 5 \\
\dot{x}_5  & = u & x_{5}(0) & = 1 \\
u  & \in [0,2.5] & t_f & = 15
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
g_{1}  & =  4.75\frac{g_{3}}{0.12+g_{3}} &\\
g_{2}  & = \frac{x_{4}}{0.1+x_{4}}\exp(-5x_{4}) &\\
g_{3}  & = 21.87\frac{x_{4}}{(x_{4}+0.4)(x_{4}+62.5)} &
\end{align}
state path constraint:
\begin{align}
x_{1} & \leq x_{2}
\end{align}
where $x_{1}$ is the concentration of the secreted protein [$l^{-1}$], $x_{2}$ is the concentration of the total protein [$l^{-1}$], $x_{3}$ is the culture cell density [$g/l$], $x_{4}$ is the substrate concentration [$g/l$], $x_{5}$ is the holdup volume [$l$], $u$ is the nutrient (glucose) feed rate [$l/h$] and $\mf{J}$ is the mass of protein produced. The supporting variables $g_{1\text{--}3}$ are, respectively, the secretion rate, the synthesis rate and the growth rate.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{examples/problem_pr_bior/graphs/u.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{examples/problem_pr_bior/graphs/x.eps}
	\caption{Control (left) and state (right) profiles for Park-Ramirez bioreactor.} \label{fig:prob_pr_bior}
\end{figure}

Simulation results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prob_pr_bior}. The optimal control profile increases for the first part of trajectory (almost 10 hours) to increase the holdup volume (magenta trajectory) and to prepare suitable environment in the bioreactor for secreted protein production. The secreted protein (blue trajectory) is not produced during this time interval, and therefore the substrate concentration (cyan trajectory) is almost constant. After around 10 hours, the value of nutrient feed rate suddenly fallen to zero and it stayed constant approximately 1 hour. The secreted protein is produced mainly in the final phase of the process, where its concentration slightly increases. The maximum achieved value of secreted protein mass ($\mf{J}$) is 32.72.

This problem was also solved by~\citep{rut10}. The resulting value of the objective function ($\mf{J}=32.72$), control and state trajectories from the PROPT optimization software are similar to the solution from the \fun{dynopt}. The small discrepancies in the compared solutions are caused mainly by the different setups of collocation points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fun{dynopt} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 10 intervals,
		\item 4 collocation points for state variables,
		\item 2 collocation points for control variable.
	\end{itemize}
	\item PROPT
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 120 colocation points,
		\item initial guess follows from the solution for 80 collocation points.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The \fun{dynopt} approach considers relatively large number of collocation points (4 points in each of 10 intervals), but it is still less than the PROPT approach (120 collocation points). \fun{Dynopt} can find the optimal solution even with the smaller number of collocation points (e.g., 3 points in each interval) and in a shorter time. However, the value of the cost function, state and control trajectories diverge compared to the PROPT solution. On the other side, the further increase of the collocation points in \fun{dynopt} algorithm requires too much time and high computational effort.

\section{Denbigh's System of Reactions}
\label{sec:brpdae}

Consider a system of chemical reactions by Denbigh \cite{den58} with the 
following reactions:
\begin{gather}
A + B \rightarrow X, \\
A + B \rightarrow P, \\
X \rightarrow Y, \\
X \rightarrow Q, \\
\end{gather}
where $A$ and $B$ are the reactants, $P$ and $Q$ are the waste products, $X$ is an intermediate and $Y$ is the desired product. The goal of the optimal control problem is to compute the temperature of the reactor $T(t)$, to maximize the yield of the product $Y$ at the end of the given batch time $t_f$. (MATLAB code for this example is located
at \subor{examples/problem10}):
\begin{equation}
\min_{\ve{u}(t)} \mf{J} = -x_{3}(t_{f}) \label{eq:denbigh_dae}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align}
\dot{x}_1 & =  -k_{1}x_{1} -k_{2}x_{1} , &\qquad x_1(0) &= 1 \\
\dot{x}_{2}& = k_{1}x_{1} - (k_{3} + k_{4})x_{2} , & \qquad x_2(0) & = 0 \\
\dot{x}_3 & =  k_{3}x_{2} , & \qquad x_3(0) & = 0 
\end{align}

where $k_{1}, \, k_{2}, \, k_{3}$ and $k_{4}$ are defined as follows:
\begin{align}
k_{1} &= 1000 e^{(-\frac{3000}{T})}, \\
k_{2} &= 1 \times 10^{7} e^{(-\frac{6000}{T})}, \\
k_{3} &= 10e^{(-\frac{3000}{T})}, \\
k_{4} &= 1 \times 10^{-3}, 
\end{align} where $x_{1} \in [0, 1] $  represents concentration
of $A$, $x_{2} \in [0, 1] $ and $x_{3} \in [0, 1]$  represent concentrations
of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The control variable of this process is a temperature of the reactor $T \in [273 \,  415]$\,K.
Batch time of this process is $t_{f} = 1000$\,s. The given batch time was divided into 10 control steps. State variables computed using \emph{dynopt}, were parametrized using 3 collocation points and the control trajectory was parametrized using 2 collocation points at each control step.  After 351 iterations, optimal value of $x_{3}(t_{f}) = 0.660487$ was
found using solver fmincon. Graphical representation of the solution is shown in Figs. \ref{fig:probdenbigh_u}
and \ref{fig:probdenbigh_x}. This problem was also solved in \cite{rut10}, using optimal control platform PROPT. Solver SNOPT reached the optimum in 233 Branch-and-bound iterations. The optimal value of  $x_{3}(t_{f}) = 0.633520$ was computed considering 70 collocation points over the given batch time.

\section{Fed-batch Reactor}
Consider a fed-batch reactor for the production of ethanol. The
optimal control problem is to maximize the yield of ethanol using the
feed rate as the control variable. The aim is to find the feed flow
rate $u(t)$ and the final time $t_f$ in order to maximize (MATLAB code for this example is located
at \subor{examples/problem_fed_batch})
\begin{equation}
  \max_{\ve{u}(t), t_f} \mf{J} = x_{3}(t_{f})x_{4}(t_{f}) 
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align*}
  \dot{x}_1 &= g_1x_1 - u\frac{x_1}{x_4}\\
  \dot{x}_2 &= -10g_1x_1 + u\frac{150-x_2}{x_4}\\
  \dot{x}_3 &= g_2x_1 - u\frac{x_3}{x_4}\\
  \dot{x}_4 &= u\\
  g_1       &= \frac{0.408}{1+x_3/16} \quad \frac{x_2}{0.22+x_2}\\
  g_2		  &= \frac{1}{1+x_3/71.5} \quad \frac{x_2}{0.44+x_2}\\
  x(0)	  &= [1~150~0~10]^{\textrm{T}}\\
  u &\in [0,12]\\
  x_4(t_f) &\leq 200
\end{align*}
where $ x_{1}(t),x_{2}(t),x_{3}(t),x_{4}(t)$ are states and $u(t)$ is control.

The optimal control trajectory and the state profiles are depicted in
Fig.~\ref{contr_prof} and Fig.~\ref{state_prof}, respectively. First,
until approximately 12 seconds, the control input is equal to zero and
the concentration of the substrate($x_2$) is decreasing. After $x_2$ reaches approximately the value 10, the control input starts
to increase progressively, what causes the increase of the product
concentration($x_3$), as well as the volume($x_4$). At the end of the control, the
volume is equal to 200, which satisfies the defined constrains. The
results obtained by using \textit{dynopt} were compared with
\textit{PROPT}~\cite{rut10} and are represented in
Tab.~\ref{tab:compar}. The optimal control trajectory by \textit{dynopt} was obtained by using 7 collocation points for states and 2 collocation points for input in each one of the 14 control intervals. The calculation required 257 iterations.
